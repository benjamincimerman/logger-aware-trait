## Fork Upgrades
--------------
- upgraded to `psr/log@^1.1.3 || ^2 || ^3`


## Installing

The recommended method of installing this library is via [Composer](//getcomposer.org/).

Run the following command from your project root:

```bash
$ composer require duncan3dc/logger-aware-trait
```

## Setup

Simply apply the trait to your classes:

```php
use duncan3dc\Log\LoggerAwareTrait;

class MyClass
{
    use LoggerAwareTrait;
}
```

Now the class will have a `getLogger()` method that you can safely call.  
If a logger has been injected using `setLogger()` then that logger will be provided, otherwise a `NullLogger` will be used instead.

A [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) has been available since the beginning of time
